    "text": "3.3 3. Table 2.1 suggests a close analogy between the notion of fitness in natural evolutionary systems and a solution quality measure in (evolutionary) problem solving. However, the two work `other way around’ from the perspective of the number of offspring. Discuss.\nI would say in biological evolution, fitness is the ‘causal efficacy’ (german Wirkunsmächtigkeit) of a replicator to replicate, given an environment.\n\n(defn fitness\n  \"Returns a real value describing the causal efficacy of a replicator to replicate given an environment.\n  A higher value means higher efficacy.\n  \"\n  [individual environment])\n\nFitness is easily understood as the height of a fitness landscape (Wrights adaptive landscape), where a higher value corresponds to higher reproductive success. A branch of the evolutionary process is ‘climbing up the mountains’ of the landscape. This is the mountain which appears in the title of Dawkins’ “Climbing Mount Improbable” (1996).\nIn evolutionary problem solving, a quality measure for a candidate solution, given a problem is used to determine the number of offspring in successive generations of solutions.\n\n(defn quality\n  \"Returns a real value that is an error value of a candidate solution given a problem.\n  A lower value means less error, and higher quality.\"\n  [individual problem])\n\n‘The other way around’ refers to the fact that in computational problem solving, the quality is usually an error to be minimized. The algorithm is descending into the valleys rather than climbing the mountains. I imagine a ball that rolls down the slopes. Like in dynamical systems theory, ‘falling into’ an attractor state of a system.\nObviously this sign reversal is trivial and does not affect the structure of the algorithm.\n\nClaude thinks the question is asking about causal direction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiology\nEC\n\n\n\n\nFitness → offspring count\nOffspring count ← quality\n\n\nCausality is emergent\nCausality is imposed\n\n\n\nIn biology, having more offspring is what defines higher fitness (measurement after the fact). In EC, we decide how many offspring to assign based on our quality measure (prescription).\n\nBiology: offspring count is the dependent variable (effect)\nEC: offspring count is the independent variable (we control it)\n\n\nI don’t agree with this. For me, fitness in biology is an objective property of the replicator. In principle, it does not require a measurement to know a fitness.",
